# Parallax Object Exchange (OBEX)

With the old Parallax Object Exchange finally decommissioned, the Parallax community has been longing for an easy way
to download individual objects and files from the https://github.com/ParallaxInc/propeller.git GitHub repository. This
program aims to provide that functionality via an automatically updating, ready-only copy of the repository.

Feature requests and bug reports are welcome; please submit them to https://github.com/DavidZemon/obex-parent/issues.
